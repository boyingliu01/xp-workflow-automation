## Review Rounds Summary

### Round 1 (Initial Review)

**Trigger**: User requested Delphi review of design document

**Results**:

| Expert | Verdict | Confidence | Critical Issues |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Expert A | REQUEST_CHANGES | 8/10 | 1 |
| Expert B | REQUEST_CHANGES | 8/10 | 3 |

**Issues Identified**:

1. **C1: TDD Practice Explanation Needs Clarification**
   - Location: xp-consensus Driver Prompt
   - Issue: Missing explicit TDD RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle
   - Severity: Critical

2. **C2: Sealed Code Isolation Mechanism Not Explained**
   - Location: xp-consensus Navigator Phase 1
   - Issue: HOW Navigator cannot access sealed.code not documented
   - Severity: Critical

3. **C3: Architecture Iteration Not Explained**
   - Location: Overall architecture
   - Issue: Single iteration vs full XP process not distinguished
   - Severity: Critical

**Action**: Fix required before approval

---

### Round 2 (After Initial Fix)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated driver-prompt.md with TDD cycle
- Added freeze skill reference to xp-consensus SKILL.md
- Added iteration explanation to DESIGN.md

**Results**:

| Expert | Verdict | Confidence | Key Finding |
|--------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Expert A | REQUEST_CHANGES | 8/10 | DESIGN.md still missing TDD cycle in main flow |
| Expert B | REQUEST_CHANGES | 9/10 | Sealed code isolation mechanism still not in DESIGN.md |

**Issues Identified**:

1. **C1 Partial Fix**: driver-prompt.md has TDD, but DESIGN.md Round 1 flow still says "generate code + tests"
2. **C2 Partial Fix**: freeze skill mentioned, but not explaining Navigator blind review isolation
3. **Confusion**: Two different isolation scenarios mixed up:
   - xp-consensus Navigator blind review: Prompt input isolation
   - test-specification-alignment Phase 2: freeze skill lock

**Action**: Fix DESIGN.md main document

---

### Round 3 (After DESIGN.md Update)

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated DESIGN.md xp-consensus Round 1 flow with explicit 🔴RED→🟢GREEN→🔄REFACTOR cycle
- Added "Sealed Code Isolation Mechanism" chapter to DESIGN.md
- Added distinction table for two isolation scenarios

**Results**:

| Expert | Verdict | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Expert A | ✅ APPROVED | 9/10 |
| Expert B | ✅ APPROVED | 9/10 |

**Consensus**: 100% APPROVED

## Final Verification

### C1: TDD Cycle in Round 1

| Verification Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| RED phase explained (test first, expect failure) | ✅ |
| GREEN phase explained (minimal code to pass) | ✅ |
| REFACTOR phase explained (optimize, keep tests passing) | ✅ |
| Reference to driver-prompt.md | ✅ |
| driver-prompt.md exists and contains TDD instructions | ✅ |

**Verdict**: ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED

### C2: Sealed Code Isolation Mechanism

| Verification Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Isolation principle explained (what is/isn't accessible) | ✅ |
| Implementation method (prompt input isolation) | ✅ |
| Prompt constraint example from navigator-phase1-prompt.md | ✅ |
| Alternative approach (freeze skill) | ✅ |
| Distinction from test-specification-alignment freeze | ✅ |
| navigator-phase1-prompt.md exists and contains blind review constraint | ✅ |

**Verdict**: ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED

### C3: Architecture Iteration

| Verification Point | Status |
|-------------------|--------|
| Single iteration vs full XP process distinguished | ✅ |
| Full XP process flow diagram | ✅ |
| gstack-retro for iteration retrospective | ✅ |

**Verdict**: ✅ COMPLETELY FIXED

## Key Improvements Made

1. **Quality-First Principles Added** (DESIGN.md lines 25-53)
   - Early discovery saves cost
   - Token consumption is investment
   - Review endpoint is APPROVED, not "review complete"

2. **TDD Cycle Explicitly Documented** (DESIGN.md lines 235-269)
   - Visual RED→GREEN→REFACTOR flow
   - Detailed explanation of each phase
   - Reference to driver-prompt.md

3. **Sealed Code Isolation Mechanism** (DESIGN.md lines 282-343)
   - Clear isolation principle
   - Implementation method (prompt input isolation)
   - Alternative approach (freeze skill)
   - Distinction from other isolation scenarios

4. **delphi-review Skill Strengthened**
   - Mandatory APPROVED terminal state
   - Gate code example added
   - Zero tolerance for incomplete reviews

## Document Quality Assessment

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Completeness | 9/10 | All core mechanisms documented |
| Clarity | 9/10 | Clear flow diagrams and explanations |
| Consistency | 9/10 | No contradictions found |
| Actionability | 9/10 | Can proceed to implementation |
| XP Coverage | 10/12 | 83% full coverage, 17% partial |

---

## Final Recommendation

**✅ APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

The design document now:
- Clearly documents TDD cycle in xp-consensus
- Explains sealed code isolation mechanism
- Distinguishes single iteration from full XP process
- Embeds quality-first principles
- Provides complete implementation guidance

No further Delphi review required. The document is ready for the next phase.
